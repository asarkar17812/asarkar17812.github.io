# About Me: 

Hello! I am an undergraduate student at New York University studying Mathematics, with a concentration in Computer Science, and a minor in Public Health. 

I aim to combine the technical aspects of my education to support a more holistic and more mindful/sustainable future in data science, especially as it relates to Public Health.
