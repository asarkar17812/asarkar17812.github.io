# About Me: 

## Introduction & Academic Interests: 

Hello! I am an third-year undergraduate student at New York University, majoring in Mathematics, with a concentration in Computer Science and a minor in Public Health.

I was born in Tampa, Florida, to my West Bengal parents who were on their green cards at the time. My parents also blessed me with a thoughtful and brilliant older sister, who introduced me to Public Health, and a resilient and rowdy, younger sister, who's youthfulness and energy remind to lighten-up and to be patient with others. From before I can remember, my father would have me doing arithmetic worksheets and IXL...

I hope to connect my passions for identifiying and understanding the various health-related aspects and outcomes of different communities and my curiosity for technical theory to help address disparities and inequities, understand collective behavior, identify causal factors in specific risk and health outcome rates, and to ultimately contribute to a better understanding of long-term health trends as whole. 

## Public Health Adjacent:

While I am invested in Public Health, I very much value perspective, especially as it relates to understanding and addressing the needs of others. 

* Computational Cognitive Science and Computational Neuroscience
* Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Agent-Based Modeling
  * Population, Family and Reproductive Health
  * Mental Health and Addiction Policy
  * Health Disparities and Inequities
  * Behavioral science
* Game Theory and Decision Science
* Cognitive Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience
* Biology, Virology, Physical Chemistry,...
* Sociology, Public Policy, Social Work, and Education (Pedagogy of STEM and Holism)
* Western and Eastern Medical History, Worldwide Medicinal Practices, Health Management

### Mathematics, Computer & Data Science, Physics and more:

As I've spent more and more of time learning and engaging with mathematics, I've learned that I currently tend to enjoy the concepts that I am able to visualize mentally. I find that having a mental picture serves my memory better long-term, and helps me form a better intuition for the idea, allowing me to recognize it beyond its initially intended scope and hopefully apply it further. This has funneled my interests/curiosity towards understanding the structure, and its characteristics, of various mathematical objects, their behaviors/reactions to change, and determining which maps and operators that are well-defined anywhere over these objects. Fortunately, this intersects with my interests in understanding health and social systems, and so, my interests form a personally-satisfying duality where one feeds back into the other. That being said, my technical interests include:

* Dynamical and Complex Systems
* Classical Mechanics and Statistical Thermodynamics, Waves, Local and Non-local Reaction-Diffusion Systems
* Algebra and Topology, Algebraic and Differential Topology, Topological Data Analysis, Functional Analysis and PDEs,...
* Algorithmic Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Forecasting, Causal, Statisitical and Probabilistic Inference, Health Data Science,...
